            <h1>Securing the data of the employees from phishing attack</h1>
            I'm hired as a penetration tester in a company. I have been asked to secure their network, systems, employee mobiles, etc. 
            To accomplish this, it is also important for me to determine the network's existing phase and understand the awareness of cybersecurity amongst the employees. 
            To determine this, i need to perform phishing attacks on employees and gather all the necessary information. Later with this, I should create awareness amongst 
            the employee about the data-stealing that has taken place and how important it is to secure their network. 
            Now once i understood that the network is insecure and may have a lot of loopholes. i should decide to test the network completely . 
            To do so, i should perform penetration testing and find the vulnerabilities on the host's systems that are live and running. 
            After determining the loopholes, i need to create a detailed analysis report and share it with the concerned department to fix them.
